this is a list of some of the things i'm either working on or have worked on in the past. i have worked on several games in different engines across the years but many of those were just for my friends and never shared publicly. 

i currently run a home server for video game servers for my friends and home media access, it runs Debian with a web server and a few Docker containers.
